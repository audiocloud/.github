# About

Audio Cloud is a collection of services that schedule, execute and automate software supported tasks dealing with
multimedia content creation and manipulation. Many systems exist that already execute e.g. media format conversion
tasks, image generation tasks, video subtitling and similar operations. Audio Cloud is different in a few key areas:

- **Interactivity**: Users can connect to and manipulate tasks in real time with a client application
- **Mixed processing**: Tasks execute on computers using software algorithms, on specialized hardware or a mix of both
- **Scalability**: Can scale to a large number of tasks and users
- **Security**: Designed with security in mind and to protect the privacy of users, their data and the data of other
  users
- **Reliability**: Reliable and able to recover from failures quickly
- **Performance**: Low oveerhead, low latency near real-time execution of tasks in a timely manner
- **Cost**: Cost effective by running on commodity hardware and utilizing open source software
- **Interoperability**: The system is designed to be interoperable and to be able to work with other systems, algorithms
  and hardware
